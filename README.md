The Power BI dashboard for the Dominican Republic's transportation system highlights several key metrics: it displays the average number of passengers transported per hour, allowing for the identification of peak times; tracks daily revenue for the selected month to facilitate trend analysis; sets clear passenger and revenue goals as benchmarks; compares total revenue and total passengers against the previous month to assess growth or decline; and calculates average revenue changes, providing insights into pricing strategies. This comprehensive overview enables stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions regarding transportation performance.
